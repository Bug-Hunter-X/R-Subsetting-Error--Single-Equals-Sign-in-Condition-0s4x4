```r
# This code attempts to subset a data frame based on a condition,
# but it contains an error that can be difficult to spot.

df <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, 3), b = c(4, 5, 6))

# Incorrect subsetting
subset_df <- df[df$a == 2 | df$b == 6, ]

# The error lies in the use of the single equals sign "==" 
# within the subsetting condition. When comparing data in R, you always need to use the double equals sign "==" 
# for the conditional comparison, not the assignment operator "=".
# This will throw a warning, and the resulting data frame will not be what was expected.

# Correct subsetting
correct_subset_df <- df[df$a == 2 | df$b == 6, ]
